<h1> Design </h1>

Some ideas of what can be in the design 

Architecture Diagram: This is a visual representation of your system's architecture. It could show how different components of your system interact with each other and with external systems.

Data Flow Diagram: This shows how data moves through your system. It could show how user inputs are processed and how data is stored and retrieved.

Database Schema: If your system uses a database, you could design a database schema. This would show the different tables in your database and their relationships.

Interface Mockups: These are visual representations of your system's user interface. They can help you plan how users will interact with your system.

Security Design: This includes any design decisions made to meet your security requirements. For example, you could describe how you plan to implement secure session management or disable autocomplete for sensitive fields.
