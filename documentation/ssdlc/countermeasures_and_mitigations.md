# Countermeasures and Mitigations

## Introduction

Identifying countermeasures and mitigations is a critical part of the Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC). Both are essential actions that an organization can take to proactively address security risks and protect their assets, reputation, and stakeholders.
Based on the DREAD and STRIDE analysis performed, we have identified the following countermeasures to address the potential threats to the Comic Book Store application.


### 1 - Spoofing:
- Implement authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) to prevent unauthorized access.
- Don't expose sensitive information in error messages or logs to prevent attackers from using them to impersonate legitimate users.
- Don't store sensitive information in plain text or easily reversible formats to prevent attackers from easily obtaining it.
### 2 - Tampering:
- Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict which users can view data and which users can modify data, enforcing least privilege.
- Implement data validation mechanisms to ensure that data is not tampered with during transit or storage.
### 3 - Repudiation:
- Implement robust logging mechanisms to record user actions and transactions, making it difficult for users to deny their actions.
- Use timestamps to provide non-repudiation for important transactions, as digital signatures might be a bit overkill to our chosen web application.
### 4 - Information Disclosure:
- Apply principle of least privilege by restricting access to sensitive information to only those who need it.
- Use as much generic error messages as possible to avoid leaking sensitive information.
- Double-check that any debugging or diagnostic features are disabled in the production environment.
### 5 - Denial of Service (DoS):
- Plan an incident response strategy to quickly identify and mitigate DoS attacks.
- Maintain regular backups of critical data and configurations to quickly recover from a successful DoS attack or server failure
### 6 - Elevation of Privilege:
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users only have the privileges necessary to perform their tasks.
- Regularly review and update access controls to minimize the risk of privilege escalation.
- Utilize strong authentication mechanisms and enforce the principle of least privilege to prevent unauthorized access.

## General Recommendations

In addition to the specific countermeasures mentioned, it is fundamental to follow the general best practices for secure software development. These include:
- Regularly updating software and libraries to patch known vulnerabilities.
- Conducting regular security assessments and penetration tests to identify and address security weaknesses.
- Implement robust logging and monitoring capabilities to track and analyze system activity, detect security incidents, and respond to threats in real-time. 
- Employ key management practices to securely manage encryption keys and secrets.
- Use secure authentication protocols and enforce least privilege principles to limit access to only what is necessary for each user or role.
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs, including form data, query parameters, and HTTP headers, to prevent malicious input manipulation.
