Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC) is a process that ensures security in software development. It's an integration of security into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The main goal of SSDLC is to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities early in the development process.

The SSDLC typically includes the following steps:

1. **Requirements/Analysis**: Identify security requirements alongside functional requirements. This could include things like data encryption needs, user access controls, or compliance requirements.

2. **Design**: In this phase, the software's architecture is designed with security in mind. This could involve making decisions about how to securely store data, how to authenticate users, and how to handle errors in a way that doesn't expose sensitive information.

3. **Implementation**: During the coding phase, developers should follow secure coding practices to prevent common security vulnerabilities. This could involve things like input validation to prevent SQL injection attacks, or using prepared statements to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

4. **Verification**: This phase involves testing the software for security vulnerabilities. This could involve code reviews, static analysis tools to automatically detect common security issues, or penetration testing to try to exploit potential vulnerabilities.

5. **Release and Maintenance**: After the software is released, it should be regularly updated and patched to fix any new security vulnerabilities that are discovered. This phase also involves monitoring the software for any unusual activity that could indicate a security breach.
