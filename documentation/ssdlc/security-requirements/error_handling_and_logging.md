# Error Handling and Logging

## Objective
Error Handling and Logging refer to the mechanisms and processes implemented within the application to manage and record errors and events that occur during its operation. These mechanisms are crucial for maintaining system stability, diagnosing issues, and protecting sensitive data.

In order to ensure the security and reliability of our web application, we have analyzed the Error Handling and Logging requirements outlined in the Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS), as these requirements serve as a guideline for implementing robust error handling mechanisms and secure logging practices.

## 1 - Log Content
| #          | ASVS Level | CWE | Verification Requirement | Valid |
|------------|------------|-----|--------------------------|-------|
| **7.1.1**  | 1          | 532 | Verify that the application does not log credentials or payment details. Session tokens should only be stored in logs in an irreversible, hashed form. | Valid |
| **7.1.2**  | 1          | 532 | Verify that the application does not log other sensitive data as defined under local privacy laws or relevant security policy. | Valid |
| **7.1.3**  | 2          | 778 | Verify that the application logs security relevant events including successful and failed authentication events, access control failures, deserialization failures, and input validation failures. | Not Valid |
| **7.1.4**  | 2          | 778 | Verify that each log event includes necessary information that would allow for a detailed investigation of the timeline when an event happens. | Not Valid |

### Analysis
* **7.1.1** and **7.1.2** : These requirements are crucial for protecting sensitive data such as credentials, payment details, and personally identifiable information (PII). Even in a simple e-commerce application, it's essential to avoid logging such sensitive information to prevent data breaches and ensure compliance with privacy regulations.
* **7.1.3** and **7.1.4** : While logging security-relevant events and including detailed information in log events are valuable for larger and more complex systems, it may be excessive for a simple e-commerce application with fewer security risks and a limited scope.

## 2 - Log Processing
| #          | ASVS Level | CWE | Verification Requirement | Valid |
|------------|------------|-----|--------------------------|-------|
| **7.2.1**  | 2          | 778 | Verify that all authentication decisions are logged, without storing sensitive session identifiers or passwords. This should include requests with relevant metadata needed for security investigations. | Not Valid |
| **7.2.2**  | 2          | 285 | Verify that all access control decisions can be logged and all failed decisions are logged. This should include requests with relevant metadata needed for security investigations. | Not Valid |

### Analysis
* **7.2.1** and **7.2.2** : While logging authentication and access control decisions is important for auditing and security analysis, it may not be necessary for a simple e-commerce application with fewer authentication mechanisms and access control requirements.

## 3 - Log Protection
| #          | ASVS Level | CWE | Verification Requirement | Valid |
|------------|------------|-----|--------------------------|-------|
| **7.3.1**  | 2          | 117 | Verify that all logging components appropriately encode data to prevent log injection. | Not Valid |
| **7.3.3**  | 2          | 200 | Verify that security logs are protected from unauthorized access and modification. | Not Valid |
| **7.3.4**  | 2          |     | Verify that time sources are synchronized to the correct time and time zone. Strongly consider logging only in UTC if systems are global to assist with post-incident forensic analysis. | Not Valid |

### Analysis
* **7.3.1** to **7.3.4** : These requirements focus on securing the logging infrastructure and ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of logs. While important for applications handling sensitive data or operating in high-security environments, implementing these measures may be overkill for a simple e-commerce application with lower security requirements.

## 4 - Error Handling
| #          | ASVS Level | CWE | Verification Requirement | Valid |
|------------|------------|-----|--------------------------|-------|
| **7.4.1**  | 1          | 210 | Verify that a generic message is shown when an unexpected or security sensitive error occurs, potentially with a unique ID which support personnel can use to investigate. | Valid |
| **7.4.2**  | 2          | 544 | Verify that exception handling (or a functional equivalent) is used across the codebase to account for expected and unexpected error conditions. | Valid |
| **7.4.3**  | 2          | 431 | Verify that a "last resort" error handler is defined which will catch all unhandled exceptions. | Valid |

### Analysis
* **7.4.1** to **7.4.3** : Error handling is important in any application to provide a smooth user experience and maintain system stability. While a simple e-commerce application may not require elaborate error handling mechanisms, having basic error messages, exception handling, and a "last resort" error handler can prevent crashes and improve user satisfaction.
