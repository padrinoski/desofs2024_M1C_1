<h1> Auth0 - Authentication API </h1>

**What is it?:** Auth0 provides a universal authentication & authorization platform for web, mobile and legacy applications. It supports various authentication methods, including social login and multi-factor authentication. They have a free tier available with some limitations.


**Risk identification** - in this step we will be identifying potential risks of using this API:
- **1.0 Dependency**
- **1.1 Data Privacy**
- **1.2 Configuration Errors**
- **1.3 Insecure API Communications**
- **1.4 Limited Customization**
- **1.5 Improper Storage of Secrets**
- **1.6 Identity Spoofing**
- **1.7 Insecure Error Handling**
- **1.8 Improper Access Control**
- **1.9 Outdated API**
- **1.10 Not Monitoring API Usage**
- **1.11 Not Implementing Rate Limiting**
- **1.12 Not Using Multi-Factor Authentication**
- **1.13 Not Following the Principle of Least Privilege**

**Risk Analysis** - in this step we will be diving deeper into each identified risk and analysing it to the core:
- **1.0 Dependecy** - the application is dependent on Auth0 for user authentication. If Auth0 experiences downtime or other issues, it could affect the ability of customers, store clerks, and store managers to log in and perform their respective actions. This could lead to loss of service and potentially loss of trust from our users. 
- **1.1 Data Privacy** - User data, including role, name, email, and password, will be handled by Auth0. If Auth0's data handling practices do not align with our application's privacy requirements or if Auth0 suffers a data breach, our users' data could be exposed. This could lead to loss of trust from our users and potential legal issues (in the scope of this project, legal issues are very unlikely to occur). 
- **1.2 Configuration Errors** - misconfigurations in the setup of the API could lead to vulnerabilities. For example, if the API is not correctly configured to enforce secure password policies, it could lead to weak passwords being used.
- **1.3 Insecure API Communications** - if the API communications are not properly secured (e.g., not using HTTPS), it could expose sensitive data to interception during packet travel.
- **1.4 Limited Customization** - the API could have limitations in customization that may prevent our team from implementing specific security requirements
- **1.5 Improper Storage of Secrets** - if API keys or other secrets used for the Auth0 API are not stored securely or are included in our source code, they could be exposed and lead to unauthorized access. This could compromise the security of our application and potentially allow unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **1.6 Identity Spoofing** - if responses from the Auth0 API are not validated, it could lead to issues like identity spoofing. This could allow an attacker to impersonate a user and perform actions on their behalf, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **1.7 Insecure Error Handling** - if our application does not handle errors from the Auth0 API securely, it could expose sensitive information to the users. This could provide attackers with information that could be used to exploit vulnerabilities in our application.
- **1.8 Improper Access Control** - if the Auth0 API's access control features are not used, users might be able to access resources and actions that they should not have access to. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and potential data breaches.
- **1.9 Outdated API** - if the Auth0 API is not kept up-to-date, our application could miss out on the latest security patches and features, leaving it vulnerable to known issues. This could lead to security vulnerabilities being exploited and potential data breaches.
- **1.10 Not Monitoring API Usage** - if the usage of the Auth0 API is not regularly monitored, unusual or suspicious activity could go unnoticed, potentially leading to security breaches. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and potential data breaches.
- **1.11 Not Implementing Rate Limiting** - if rate limiting is not implemented, it could allow for brute force attacks. This could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and potential data breaches.
- **1.12 Not Using Multi-Factor Authentication** - if the Auth0 API supports multi-factor authentication and it's not used, it could lead to weaker security and easier account compromise. This could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and potential data breaches.
- **1.13 Not Following the Principle of Least Privilege** - if your application requests more access than necessary, it could lead to unnecessary risks if those permissions are exploited. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and potential data breaches.

**Risk Evaluation** - in this step, an evaluation will determine which risks need to be addressed, ranking them based on likelihood and impact:
- **1.0 Dependecy** - **(High Impact, Medium Likelihood)** while Auth0 is a reliable service, any downtime or issues on their end could directly impact our application's functionality. This risk is of high impact due to the potential disruption of service, but medium likelihood given Auth0's reliability. 
- **1.1 Data Privacy** - **(High Impact, Low Likelihood)** a breach of user data would have a high impact, damaging trust and potentially leading to legal issues. However, Auth0 has robust security measures in place, making this risk low likelihood.
- **1.2 Configuration Errors** - **(High Impact, High Likelihood)** misconfigurations in the setup of the API could lead to vulnerabilities, such as weak passwords being used. This risk is both high impact, due to the potential for unauthorized access, and high likelihood, as configuration errors are common.
- **1.3 Insecure API Communications** - **(High Impact, Low Likelihood)** if the API communications are not properly secured (e.g., not using HTTPS), it could expose sensitive data to interception during packet travel. This risk is high impact due to the potential exposure of sensitive data, but low likelihood, as Auth0 uses HTTPS for all communications.
- **1.4 Limited Customization** - **(Medium Impact, Medium Likelihood)** the API could have limitations in customization that may prevent our team from implementing specific security requirements. This risk is medium impact, as it could limit your ability to meet your project's specific security needs, and medium likelihood, as third-party APIs often have some limitations in customization.
- **1.5 Improper Storage of Secrets** - **(High Impact, High Likelihood)** if API keys or other secrets are not stored securely, they could be exposed, leading to unauthorized access. This risk is both high impact and high likelihood without proper security measures.
- **1.6 Identity Spoofing** - **(High Impact, Medium Likelihood)** if responses from the Auth0 API are not validated, it could lead to identity spoofing. This risk is high impact due to potential unauthorized access, but medium likelihood with proper validation.
- **1.7 Insecure Error Handling** - **(Medium Impact, Medium Likelihood)** exposing sensitive information through error messages could provide attackers with exploitable information. This risk is medium impact and likelihood.
- **1.8 Improper Access Control** - **(High Impact, High Likelihood)** without proper access control, users could access unauthorized resources. This risk is both high impact and high likelihood without proper implementation.
- **1.9 Outdated API** - **(Medium Impact, Low Likelihood)** using an outdated API could leave our application vulnerable to known issues. This risk is medium impact due to potential security vulnerabilities, but low likelihood given regular updates.
- **1.10 Not Monitoring API Usage** - **(High Impact, Medium Likelihood)** without monitoring, unusual or suspicious activity could go unnoticed. This risk is high impact due to potential security breaches, but medium likelihood with proper monitoring.
- **1.11 Not Implementing Rate Limiting** - **(High Impact, High Likelihood)** without rate limiting, our application could be vulnerable to brute force attacks. This risk is both high impact and high likelihood without proper implementation.
- **1.12 Not Using Multi-Factor Authentication** - **(High Impact, Medium Likelihood)** not using multi-factor authentication could lead to weaker security. This risk is high impact due to potential account compromise, but medium likelihood given the option to implement it.
- **1.13 Not Following the Principle of Least Privilege** - **(High Impact, High Likelihood)** requesting more access than necessary could lead to unnecessary risks. For example, a store clerk should only have permissions necessary to perform their job, such as adding new comic books, however if this principle is not follwed then the Store Clerk could have additional permissions that they don't need, such as the ability to manage Store Clerk accounts. If a malicious actor were to gain access to a Store Clerk account, they would then have the ability to manage Store Clerk accounts. This risk is both high impact and high likelihood without proper implementation.

**Risk Mitigation** - this is the final step of this assessment, and it will serve the purpose of mitigating the risks, and how to handle them in case of a worst case scenario.

- **1.0 Dependency**: Implement a fallback authentication method in case Auth0 experiences downtime. Regularly monitor Auth0's status and have a contingency plan in place.
- **1.1 Data Privacy**: Ensure that Auth0's data handling practices align with our application's privacy requirements. Regularly review Auth0's privacy policy and data handling practices.
- **1.2 Configuration Errors**: Ensure that the Auth0 API is correctly configured to enforce secure password policies and other security measures. Regularly review and update the API configuration.
- **1.3 Insecure API Communications**: Always use HTTPS for communication with the Auth0 API to ensure that all data transmitted between our application and the API is encrypted and secure.
- **1.4 Limited Customization**: Understand the limitations of Auth0 and plan our application's security requirements accordingly. If necessary, consider using additional security measures outside of Auth0.
- **1.5 Improper Storage of Secrets**: Store API keys or other secrets securely. Do not include them in your our code. Consider using environment variables or a secure secret management system. Regularly rotate secrets and use different secrets for different environments.
- **1.6 Identity Spoofing**: Always validate the responses from the Auth0 API. This can help prevent issues like identity spoofing. Implement proper error handling to ensure that failed validation does not expose sensitive information or disrupt the user experience.
- **1.7 Insecure Error Handling**: Ensure that our application handles errors from the Auth0 API in a way that does not expose sensitive information. For example, don't display detailed error messages to the user that could reveal information about your system. Instead, log the detailed error information server-side where it can be reviewed by authorized personnel.
- **1.8 Improper Access Control**: Use the Auth0 API's access control features to ensure that users can only access the resources and actions that they are authorized for. Regularly review and update access controls to ensure they are functioning as intended and that changes in user roles or permissions are accurately reflected.
- **1.9 Outdated API**: Keep the Auth0 API up-to-date to ensure we have the latest security patches and features. Regularly check for and apply updates.
- **1.10 Not Monitoring API Usage**: Regularly monitor the usage of the Auth0 API to detect any unusual or suspicious activity. Consider using a monitoring and alerting tool.
- **1.11 Not Implementing Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks. Auth0 provides built-in anomaly detection features that can help with this.
- **1.12 Not Using Multi-Factor Authentication**: If possible, use multi-factor authentication for added security. Auth0 supports multi-factor authentication.
- **1.13 Not Following the Principle of Least Privilege**: Only request the minimum level of access necessary for our application to function. Regularly review and update access controls to ensure they follow this principle.


// need to contextualize all of these risks with our application, to see what really needs to be done

//todo identify Auth0 features and see what exists and can be used to implement the ASVS requirements.
