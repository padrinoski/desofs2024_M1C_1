<h1> Auth0 - Authentication API </h1>

**What is it?:** Auth0 provides a universal authentication & authorization platform for web, mobile and legacy applications. It supports various authentication methods, including social login and multi-factor authentication. They have a free tier available with some limitations.


**Risk identification** - in this step we will be identifying potential risks of using this API:
- **1.0 Dependency** - on a third-party service if the API experiences downtime or other issues, it could affect the application's ability to authenticate users.
- **1.1 Data Privacy** - user data will be handled by Auth0, so it is crucial to ensure that Auth0's data handling practices align with the application's privacy requirements.
- **1.2 ????** - TBD

**Risk Analysis** - in this step we will be diving deeper into each identified risk and analysing it to the core:
- **1.0 Dependecy** - TBD 
- **1.1 Data Privacy** - TBD 
- **1.2 ????** - TBD

**Risk Evaluation** - in this step, an evaluation will determine which risks need to be addressed, ranking them based on likelihood and impact:
- **1.0 Dependecy** - TBD 
- **1.1 Data Privacy** - TBD 
- **1.2 ????** - TBD

**Risk Mitigation** - this is the final step of this assessment, and it will serve the purpose of mitigating the risks, and how to handle them in case of a worst case scenario.
- **1.0 Dependecy** - TBD 
- **1.1 Data Privacy** - TBD 
- **1.2 ????** - TBD


//todo identify Auth0 features and see what exists and can be used to implement the ASVS requirements.
