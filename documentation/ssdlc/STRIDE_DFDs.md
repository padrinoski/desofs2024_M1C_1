|        Spoofing        | An attacker could pretend to be a legitimate user by stealing or guessing user credentials.                                | Implementing strong authentication mechanisms like multi-factor authentication, and by securely storing and transmitting user credentials. |
|       Tampering        | An attacker could attempt to modify data in transit between the application and the database, or directly in the database. | Using secure communication protocols (like HTTPS), and by implementing access controls and data integrity checks in the database.          |
|      Repudiation       | A user could deny performing an action, like registering or logging in.                                                    | Keeping detailed logs of user activity, and by implementing non-repudiation mechanisms like digital signatures.                            |
| Information Disclosure | Sensitive user information could be exposed to unauthorized parties during transmission or storage.                        | Encrypting data in transit and at rest, and by implementing strong access controls.                                                        |
|   Denial of Service    | An attacker could overwhelm the system with requests, preventing legitimate users from registering or logging in.          | Implementing rate limiting, and by using scalable and resilient system architectures.                                                      |
| Elevation of Privilege | An attacker could gain unauthorized access to privileged functionalities or data.                                          | Implementing the principle of least privilege, and by regularly reviewing and updating user permissions.                                   |
