# P2 - Pipeline implementation and Code-Base

In the present document, all the work developed during this phase is presented, as well as its contributor(s).

This phase is a continuation of the last phase, which envolves the automatization of the workflow environment using CI/CD pipelines with Github Actions and the implementation  of the domain and the respective functionalities.

### [Create pipeline implementation](https://github.com/padrinoski/desofs2024_M1C_1/issues/11)
The automatic workflow on GitHub actions is a CICD automation feature that allows several validations to be made whenever a new piece of code is added to the structure. Everytime any branch pushes something, it will automatically trigger the workflow by the “on push” call. Then, will prepare all the environment, setting up .NET (for the c# project), Java (for the dynamic testing - dotnet-trace requires it), Node (for the dynamic testing - dotnet-trace output modulation on Speedscope) and SonarScan (static testing - SonarQube). Then, the code is checked out so that the runner has access to the code, and then dotnet build and dotnet run are tested. After this, the SonarQube quality check is made and after the application is started on nohup (deatached) so that another commands can be runned. Then, the dotnet-trace is runned for 20s with the application running and the report is exported as an artifact, since is only visible using the encoding website of Speedscope.

### [User Registration and Authentication](https://github.com/padrinoski/desofs2024_M1C_1/issues/1)

In this US the main goal was to authenticate using Auth0, however, since the plan was to implement the domain in our own API and setup all the relevant connections and dependencies, the User Registration and Authentication was done as a secondary backup mechanism, in case Auth0 was down. This means that right now we have a register and login system implemented by us in our API, but the main focus will be in the next delivery where we will be working in the front-end and that's where we will implement Auth0, and all the relevant security features. Functional testing was also implemented.

### [Manage Admin Accounts (Store Manager)](https://github.com/padrinoski/desofs2024_M1C_1/issues/10)
In this US, the main objective was to have CRUD operations act against users with Role = Admin. This means we could create / delete / update admin accounts. This was implemented in our API, however this will be done aswell, using Auth0 after we begin working on the frontend. Functional testing was also done for this US.
